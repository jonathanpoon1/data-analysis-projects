# Projects:

## Python
For this project I studied NHL data starting from 2000 to determine if there is a relationship between which arena the Toronto Maple Leafs play in and their performance. 
## R
In this project I attempted to train a model using Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) data to predict a winner of a given match.
## SQL
During this project, I studied RLCS data to determine which regions are better than others when they play against each other.
