# Projects:

## Pokemon Web Scraping
During this project, I used Python along with the library BeautifulSoup in order to scrape data from the Internet. I used this data to create meaningful visualizations in Microsoft Power BI that I was able derive conclusions from. 
## RLCS predictor model
In this project I trained a model in R using Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) data to predict a winner of a given match.
## RLCS analysis
For this project, I studied RLCS data using SQL to figure out which regions are better than others when they play against each other and how well they do against each other overall.
## Star Wars script analysis
During this project, I studied the scripts using Python of the original 3 Star Wars movies to identify which characters and movies had the most lines of dialogue and if there is a relationship between the most words and pairs of words spoken. 
## NHL analysis
For this project I studied NHL data using Python starting from the 2000-01 season up to the 2019-2020 season to determine if there is a relationship between which arena the Toronto Maple Leafs play in and their performance.
